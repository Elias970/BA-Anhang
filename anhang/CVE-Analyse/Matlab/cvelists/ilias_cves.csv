CVE-2022-45916;2022-12-07T00:00:00;ILIAS before 7.16 allows XSS.;5.4;A3
CVE-2023-45869;2023-10-26T00:00:00;ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12) allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely, when a highly privileged account accesses an XSS payload. The injected commands are executed via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class (/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS installation and the underlying operating system.;9.0;A3
CVE-2023-45868;2023-10-26T00:00:00;The Learning Module in ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12 release) allows an attacker (with basic user privileges) to achieve a high-impact Directory Traversal attack on confidentiality and availability. By exploiting this network-based vulnerability, the attacker can move specified directories, normally outside the documentRoot, to a publicly accessible location via the PHP function rename(). This results in a total loss of confidentiality, exposing sensitive resources, and potentially denying access to the affected component and the operating system's components. To exploit this, an attacker must manipulate a POST request during the creation of an exercise unit, by modifying the old_name and new_name parameters via directory traversal. However, it's essential to note that, when exploiting this vulnerability, the specified directory will be relocated from its original location, rendering all files obtained from there unavailable.;8.1;A5
CVE-2023-45867;2023-10-26T00:00:00;"ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory Traversal local file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module. An attacker with a privileged account, typically holding the tutor role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can access files that are readable by the web server user www-data; this may include sensitive configuration files and documents located outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting directory traversal sequences in order to access unauthorized files. This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive files, such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security. This issue poses a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely exploitable over the internet.";6.5;A5
CVE-2023-36487;2023-06-29T00:00:00;The password reset function in ILIAS 7.0_beta1 through 7.20 and 8.0_beta1 through 8.1 allows remote attackers to take over the account.;9.8;A7
CVE-2023-36486;2023-12-25T00:00:00;The workflow-engine of ILIAS before 7.23 and 8 before 8.3 allows remote authenticated users to run arbitrary system commands on the application server as the application user by uploading a workflow definition file with a malicious filename.;7.2;A1
CVE-2023-36485;2023-12-25T00:00:00;The workflow-engine of ILIAS before 7.23 and 8 before 8.3 allows remote authenticated users to run arbitrary system commands on the application server as the application user via a malicious BPMN2 workflow definition file.;7.2;A1
CVE-2023-36484;2023-06-29T00:00:00;ILIAS 7.21 and 8.0_beta1 through 8.2 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).;6.1;A3
CVE-2023-36488;2023-06-29T00:00:00;ILIAS 7.21 and 8.0_beta1 through 8.2 is vulnerable to stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS).;5.4;A3
